       git-gui - A portable graphical interface to Git

       _g_i_t _g_u_i [<command>] [arguments]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git. _g_i_t _g_u_i focuses on allowing users to make changes to their
       repository by making new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches, performing local merges, and
       fetching/pushing to remote repositories.

       Unlike _g_i_t_k, _g_i_t _g_u_i focuses on commit generation and single file annotation and does not show project
       history. It does however supply menu actions to start a _g_i_t_k session from within _g_i_t _g_u_i.

       _g_i_t _g_u_i is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X, and Windows (under both Cygwin and MSYS).
       To the extent possible OS specific user interface guidelines are followed, making _g_i_t _g_u_i a fairly native
       interface for users.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       blame
           Start a blame viewer on the specified file on the given version (or working directory if not
           specified).

       browser
           Start a tree browser showing all files in the specified commit. Files selected through the browser are
           opened in the blame viewer.

       citool
           Start _g_i_t _g_u_i and arrange to make exactly one commit before exiting and returning to the shell. The
           interface is limited to only commit actions, slightly reducing the applicationâ€™s startup time and
           simplifying the menubar.

       version
           Display the currently running version of _g_i_t _g_u_i.

       ggiitt gguuii bbllaammee MMaakkeeffiillee
           Show the contents of the file _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e in the current working directory, and provide annotations for
           both the original author of each line, and who moved the line to its current location. The uncommitted
           file is annotated, and uncommitted changes (if any) are explicitly attributed to _N_o_t _Y_e_t _C_o_m_m_i_t_t_e_d.

       ggiitt gguuii bbllaammee vv00..9999..88 MMaakkeeffiillee
           Show the contents of _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e in revision _v_0_._9_9_._8 and provide annotations for each line. Unlike the
           above example the file is read from the object database and not the working directory.

       ggiitt gguuii bbllaammee ----lliinnee==110000 MMaakkeeffiillee
           Loads annotations as described above and automatically scrolls the view to center on line _1_0_0.

       ggiitt gguuii cciittooooll
           Make one commit and return to the shell when it is complete. This command returns a non-zero exit code
           if the window was closed in any way other than by making a commit.

       ggiitt gguuii cciittooooll ----aammeenndd
           Automatically enter the _A_m_e_n_d _L_a_s_t _C_o_m_m_i_t mode of the interface.

       ggiitt gguuii cciittooooll ----nnooccoommmmiitt
           Behave as normal citool, but instead of making a commit simply terminate with a zero exit code. It
           still checks that the index does not contain any unmerged entries, so you can use it as a GUI version
           of ggiitt--mmeerrggeettooooll(1)

       ggiitt cciittooooll
           Same as ggiitt gguuii cciittooooll (above).

       ggiitt gguuii bbrroowwsseerr mmaaiinntt
           Show a browser for the tree of the _m_a_i_n_t branch. Files selected in the browser can be viewed with the
           internal blame viewer.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       ggiittkk(1)
           The Git repository browser. Shows branches, commit history and file differences. gitk is the utility
           started by _g_i_t _g_u_i's Repository Visualize actions.

OOTTHHEERR
       _g_i_t _g_u_i is actually maintained as an independent project, but stable versions are distributed as part of
       the Git suite for the convenience of end users.

       The official repository of the _g_i_t _g_u_i project can be found at:

GGIITT
       Part of the ggiitt(1) suite
